// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = 'This is when we determine what it is that the software needs to be able to do.'

const design = `This involves the preliminary or high-level design of the main modules with an overall picture of how the parts fit together.`

const implementation = `This is the part of the process where software engineers program the code for the project.`

const testingAndIntegration = `Testing and Integration is an important part of the process which ensures that defects are recognized as soon as possible and that, in the end, the code does what it is supposed to do.`

const maintain = `In a post-production, live software environment, the system is in maintenance mode. An example of routine maintenance would be staying up to date on upgrades.`
